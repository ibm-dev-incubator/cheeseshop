workers
-------

Workers are installed as executables. They are all named 'cs-worker-something' and take a sha1sum as an argument. Right now workers pull from the filesystem but soon they will pull from swift. The `player_names` worker can be used as a starting point for other workers.


.. code:: shell

    $ export REPLAY_DIR=/home/nibz/projects/starcraft/replays/

    $ ls $REPLAY_DIR
